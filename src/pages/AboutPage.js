    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>We are a small team of people who were disillusioned with the retirement prospects for the 21st century. We all had the same problem of spending too much time doing the tedious part of managing our investments, but weren’t interested in paying high management fees for someone else to do it. Passiv was conceived as an attempt to make it easier by automating the tedious bits and getting rid of manual data entry.</p>
